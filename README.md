# Yoast Primary Taxonomy Shortcode

Allows you to display the primary custom taxonomy of a post by using a shortcode. Requires Yoast SEO. 
You can use it with any custom taxonomy you create.

## Install Steps:
1. Upload `primary_tax.php` to wp-content/plugins directory
2. Activate the plugin
3. Use the shortcode `[primary_term tax="taxonomy"]` wherever you want to display the primary taxonomy.

## Support
I will do my best to improve upon this code, but there is no guarantee I will continue working on this. The code is simple enough to survive a few WP and Yoast updates. If you have any issues, please post them here and I will do my best to help :)
